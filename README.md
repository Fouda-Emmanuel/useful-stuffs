# Useful Stuffs ðŸ’»

This repository is a personal collection of **tech tips, solutions, and challenges** Iâ€™ve encountered while learning or working on projects.  

I created this repo so I can **save helpful notes and tricks** in one place and easily refer back to them whenever needed.  

Itâ€™s a **work in progress**, so more tips and solutions will be added over time.  

Feel free to explore and try things out.
